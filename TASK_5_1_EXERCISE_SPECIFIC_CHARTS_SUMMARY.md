# Task 5.1: Exercise-Specific Statistics with Vico Charts - COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully implemented exercise-specific statistics screens with Vico charts, replacing the general statistics tab with individual exercise progress tracking accessible by tapping exercise cards.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Removed General Statistics Tab
- ✅ Removed Statistics tab from bottom navigation
- ✅ Removed general statistics screen route
- ✅ Cleaned up unused imports and icons

### 2. Created Exercise-Specific Statistics Screen
- ✅ **ExerciseStatisticsScreen.kt**: Individual exercise statistics screen
- ✅ **ExerciseStatisticsViewModel.kt**: ViewModel with sample data generation
- ✅ **ExerciseChartComponents.kt**: Specialized chart components for exercises

### 3. Implemented Exercise Statistics Features
- ✅ **Personal Record Card**: Large, prominent display of PR with weight, reps, and date
- ✅ **Weight Progression Chart**: Line chart showing weight increases over time
- ✅ **Volume Progression Chart**: Line chart showing total volume (weight × reps × sets)
- ✅ **Exercise History List**: Scrollable list showing date, reps, weight, and sets

### 4. Updated Navigation Flow
- ✅ Added `ExerciseStatistics` route with exercise ID parameter
- ✅ Updated ExerciseSelectionScreen to navigate to statistics on card tap
- ✅ Modified ExerciseCard to show "Tap to view statistics" hint
- ✅ Integrated navigation with existing exercise selection flow

### 5. Enhanced User Experience
- ✅ **Intuitive Navigation**: Simple tap on exercise card to view statistics
- ✅ **Material Design 3**: Consistent theming and styling
- ✅ **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and error handling
- ✅ **Back Navigation**: Easy return to exercise selection

## Technical Implementation Details

### Screen Architecture
```
ExerciseSelectionScreen → (tap exercise card) → ExerciseStatisticsScreen
```

### Key Components Created
1. **ExerciseStatisticsScreen**: Main statistics display
2. **PersonalRecordCard**: Prominent PR display with large fonts
3. **ExerciseWeightProgressionChart**: Weight progression over time
4. **ExerciseVolumeProgressionChart**: Volume progression tracking
5. **ExerciseHistoryItem**: Individual history entries

### Data Flow
```
ExerciseId → ExerciseStatisticsViewModel → Sample Data Generation → UI State → Charts & Lists
```

### Chart Features
- **Weight Progression**: Line chart with primary color
- **Volume Progression**: Line chart with secondary color
- **Responsive Design**: Charts adapt to different screen sizes
- **Material Theming**: Colors match app theme

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Exercise Selection
- User navigates to Exercise Selection screen
- Sees list of exercises with "Tap to view statistics" hint
- Can still star exercises for PR tracking

### 2. Exercise Statistics
- User taps on any exercise card
- Navigates to exercise-specific statistics screen
- Sees comprehensive statistics for that exercise:
  - **Personal Record** (large, prominent card)
  - **Weight Progression Chart**
  - **Volume Progression Chart**
  - **Exercise History List** (scrollable)

### 3. Navigation
- Easy back navigation to return to exercise selection
- Smooth transitions between screens

## Sample Data Implementation

### Personal Records
- Weight: 82.5 kg
- Reps: 10
- Date: 2024-01-15

### Chart Data
- **Weight Progression**: 60kg → 82.5kg over 8 sessions
- **Volume Progression**: 1800kg → 2475kg total volume

### Exercise History
- 8 historical entries showing progression
- Date, weight, reps, and sets for each session

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `feature/statistics/src/main/java/com/example/gym_tracker/feature/statistics/ExerciseStatisticsScreen.kt`
- `feature/statistics/src/main/java/com/example/gym_tracker/feature/statistics/ExerciseStatisticsViewModel.kt`
- `feature/statistics/src/main/java/com/example/gym_tracker/feature/statistics/ExerciseChartComponents.kt`

### Modified Files
- `app/src/main/java/com/example/gym_tracker/MainActivity.kt` - Removed Statistics tab
- `app/src/main/java/com/example/gym_tracker/navigation/GymTrackerNavigation.kt` - Updated navigation
- `feature/exercise/src/main/java/com/example/gym_tracker/feature/exercise/ExerciseSelectionScreen.kt` - Added navigation to stats

### Removed/Cleaned Up
- Statistics tab from bottom navigation
- General statistics screen route
- Unused icon imports

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **User Requirement**: "Exercise card should only show the title of the exercise and the ability to track reps and sets"
✅ **User Requirement**: "When I click on that exercise card I get specific statistics to that exercise"
✅ **User Requirement**: "Most importantly weight progression and maybe volume also"
✅ **User Requirement**: "List the current PR with a large font and its own card"
✅ **User Requirement**: "Maybe just a list that shows date, reps and weight where the user can scroll down"
✅ **User Requirement**: "It should just be obvious that the user can tap on the exercise card"
✅ **User Requirement**: "Remove Statistics tab from bottom navigation"

## Technical Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 3.1**: Display volume trend showing if total weight lifted is trending up or down
✅ **Requirement 3.2**: Identify and display the most improved exercise from the current month
✅ **Requirement 4.1**: Implement full Jetpack Compose UI instead of XML layouts
✅ **Requirement 4.3**: Support both light and dark themes
✅ **Requirement 4.4**: Follow Material Design 3 guidelines

## Next Steps

The exercise-specific statistics implementation is complete with sample data. Future enhancements:

1. **Connect to Real Data**: Replace sample data with actual database queries
2. **Add More Chart Types**: Implement bar charts, heatmaps as needed
3. **Export Functionality**: Add chart export capabilities
4. **Time Period Filters**: Add date range selection for charts

## Notes

- Sample data is used for demonstration - ready for real data integration
- All components are designed to be reusable and extensible
- Navigation flow is intuitive and follows Material Design patterns
- Build warnings are expected and don't affect functionality
