3. WHEN viewing statistics THEN the system SHALL show comparative analysis between different time periods
4. WHEN tracking progress THEN the system SHALL display volume progression (weight × reps × sets)
5. WHEN viewing workout data THEN the system SHALL provide muscle group distribution charts
6. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL show personal records and achievement tracking
7. WHEN viewing trends THEN the system SHALL display moving averages and trend lines
8. WHEN comparing exercises THEN the system SHALL support multi-exercise comparison charts

### Requirement 4: Modern UI/UX Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want a modern, intuitive interface so that I can efficiently track my workouts and view my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the app THEN the system SHALL implement full Jetpack Compose UI instead of XML layouts
2. WHEN navigating THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations and transitions
3. WHEN viewing data THEN the system SHALL support both light and dark themes
4. WHEN interacting THEN the system SHALL follow Material Design 3 guidelines
5. WHEN using different devices THEN the system SHALL be responsive across various screen sizes
6. WHEN accessing features THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive gesture-based interactions
7. WHEN viewing content THEN the system SHALL implement proper accessibility features
8. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states and error handling

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Workout Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want advanced workout management features so that I can create custom routines and track detailed metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating workouts THEN the system SHALL support custom workout templates and routines
2. WHEN tracking exercises THEN the system SHALL record rest times between sets
3. WHEN logging workouts THEN the system SHALL support supersets and circuit training
4. WHEN planning workouts THEN the system SHALL provide exercise recommendations based on history
5. WHEN tracking progress THEN the system SHALL calculate and display one-rep max estimates
6. WHEN reviewing workouts THEN the system SHALL show workout duration and intensity metrics
7. WHEN managing exercises THEN the system SHALL support exercise variations and progressions

### Requirement 6: Performance and Data Analytics

**User Story:** As a user, I want detailed analytics and insights so that I can optimize my training and track long-term progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL display weekly, monthly, and yearly progress summaries
2. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL calculate training volume and intensity trends
3. WHEN tracking consistency THEN the system SHALL show workout frequency and streak tracking
4. WHEN reviewing progress THEN the system SHALL identify strength imbalances and suggest corrections
5. WHEN planning training THEN the system SHALL provide periodization insights and recommendations
6. WHEN comparing periods THEN the system SHALL show before/after comparisons with statistical significance
7. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support data export in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, PDF reports)

### Requirement 7: Technology Stack Upgrade

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modern Android development practices so that the app is maintainable and follows current best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the app THEN the system SHALL use Kotlin Multiplatform for shared business logic
2. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use Hilt for dependency injection
3. WHEN handling async operations THEN the system SHALL use Kotlin Coroutines and Flow
4. WHEN implementing UI THEN the system SHALL use Jetpack Compose with Material Design 3
5. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive unit and integration tests
6. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL use Gradle Version Catalogs for dependency management
7. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL support CI/CD pipeline integration

### Requirement 8: AI-Powered Exercise Coaching

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI-powered exercise guidance so that I can improve my form, understand muscle activation, and receive personalized training tips.

#### Acceptance Criteria
