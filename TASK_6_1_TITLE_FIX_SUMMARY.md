# Task 6.1: Workout Title Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

**Problem**: The workout screen title was showing generic "Workout" instead of the actual workout name (e.g., "Push Day", "Pull Day", etc.).

**Root Cause**: The `getWorkoutName()` function in `WorkoutExercisesViewModel` was only mapping hardcoded IDs ("1", "2", "3") to workout names, but the actual workout IDs from the database are UUIDs or different values.

## Technical Analysis

### The Problem:
```kotlin
private fun getWorkoutName(workoutId: String): String {
    return when (workoutId) {
        "1" -> "Push Day"      // Only works for hardcoded IDs
        "2" -> "Pull Day"
        "3" -> "Leg Day"
        else -> "Workout"      // All real workout IDs fall here
    }
}
```

### Actual Workflow:
1. **WorkoutScreen** displays workouts with real database IDs (UUIDs)
2. **User clicks workout** → Navigation passes real workout ID (e.g., "uuid-123-456")
3. **WorkoutExercisesViewModel** tries to map ID → Falls back to "Workout"
4. **Screen title** shows generic "Workout" instead of actual name

## Solution Implemented

### Dynamic Workout Name Storage
Added a companion object storage system to dynamically store and retrieve workout names.

**Files Modified:**
1. `feature/workout/src/main/java/com/example/gym_tracker/feature/workout/WorkoutExercisesViewModel.kt`
2. `feature/workout/src/main/java/com/example/gym_tracker/feature/workout/WorkoutScreen.kt`

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Enhanced ViewModel Storage
```kotlin
companion object {
    // Static storage to persist across ViewModel instances
    private val workoutExercisesStorage = mutableMapOf<String, MutableList<WorkoutExerciseInstanceData>>()
    
    // NEW: Static storage for workout names
    private val workoutNamesStorage = mutableMapOf<String, String>()
    
    // NEW: Function to store workout name for an ID
    fun setWorkoutName(workoutId: String, workoutName: String) {
        workoutNamesStorage[workoutId] = workoutName
    }
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced Name Resolution
```kotlin
private fun getWorkoutName(workoutId: String): String {
    // NEW: First check if we have the name stored dynamically
    workoutNamesStorage[workoutId]?.let { return it }
    
    // Fallback to hardcoded mapping for backwards compatibility
    return when (workoutId) {
        "1" -> "Push Day"
        "2" -> "Pull Day"
        "3" -> "Leg Day"
        else -> "Workout"
    }
}
```

#### 3. Store Names During Navigation
```kotlin
// In WorkoutScreen - both grid and list views
onWorkoutClick = { workout -> 
    // NEW: Store workout name for the exercises screen
    WorkoutExercisesViewModel.setWorkoutName(
        workout.workout.id, 
        workout.workout.name
    )
    // Navigate to workout exercises screen
    onNavigateToExerciseTracking(workout.workout.id)
}
```

## Technical Flow

### Before the Fix:
1. **Click "My Custom Workout"** → Navigate with ID "uuid-abc-123"
2. **ViewModel.getWorkoutName("uuid-abc-123")** → No match in hardcoded mapping
3. **Returns "Workout"** → Generic title shown
4. **Screen title**: "Workout" ❌

### After the Fix:
1. **Click "My Custom Workout"** → Store name mapping + Navigate with ID
2. **ViewModel.setWorkoutName("uuid-abc-123", "My Custom Workout")**
3. **ViewModel.getWorkoutName("uuid-abc-123")** → Found in dynamic storage
4. **Returns "My Custom Workout"** → Actual title shown
5. **Screen title**: "My Custom Workout" ✅

## User Experience Impact

### Before:
- ❌ All workout screens showed generic "Workout" title
- ❌ No visual indication of which workout you're in
- ❌ Poor navigation context

### After:
- ✅ Screen titles show actual workout names
- ✅ Clear visual indication of current workout
- ✅ Professional app behavior
- ✅ Better navigation context

## Debug Logging Enhanced

Added comprehensive logging to track the title resolution:

```kotlin
// Debug logging
println("DEBUG: Loading workout ID='$workoutId', workout name='$workoutName'")
println("DEBUG: Found ${exercises.size} exercises")
println("DEBUG: Storage contents: ${workoutExercisesStorage.keys}")
```

This helps verify:
- What workout IDs are being passed
- What workout names are being resolved
- Whether the dynamic storage is working

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Custom Workout Names
1. Create workout named "Upper Body Strength"
2. Navigate to workout → Title shows "Upper Body Strength" ✅

### Scenario 2: Default Workout Names  
1. Navigate to existing "Push Day" workout
2. Title shows "Push Day" ✅

### Scenario 3: Multiple Workouts
1. Navigate between different workouts
2. Each shows its correct name ✅

### Scenario 4: Persistence
1. Navigate to workout → See correct title
2. Navigate away and back → Title still correct ✅

## Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current State:
- ✅ **Dynamic name storage**: Works with any workout name
- ✅ **Session persistence**: Names persist during app session
- ✅ **Backwards compatibility**: Still works with hardcoded IDs
- ❌ **App restart**: Dynamic names lost when app closes

### Future Enhancements:
- **Database integration**: Get workout names directly from repository
- **Caching**: Implement proper caching mechanism
- **Validation**: Add validation for workout name storage

## Files Modified
1. `feature/workout/src/main/java/com/example/gym_tracker/feature/workout/WorkoutExercisesViewModel.kt`
2. `feature/workout/src/main/java/com/example/gym_tracker/feature/workout/WorkoutScreen.kt`

## Testing Results
✅ **App builds successfully**
✅ **Dynamic workout name storage works**
✅ **Screen titles show correct workout names**
✅ **Navigation preserves workout context**
✅ **Debug logging confirms proper operation**
✅ **Backwards compatibility maintained**

## Summary

This fix transforms the workout screen titles from generic "Workout" to showing the actual workout names by:

1. **Dynamic Storage**: Storing workout names when navigating
2. **Enhanced Resolution**: Checking dynamic storage before fallback
3. **Navigation Integration**: Storing names during workout selection
4. **Session Persistence**: Names persist across navigation

The result is a much more professional and user-friendly experience where users always know which workout they're currently viewing.
