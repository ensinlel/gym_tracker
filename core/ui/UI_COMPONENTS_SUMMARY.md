    subtitle = "Chest / Shoulders / Triceps",
    exerciseCount = 8,
    duration = "60 min",
    onClick = { navigateToExercises() }
)

// Dashboard homepage
CalendarCard(
    selectedDate = LocalDate.now(),
    workoutDates = workoutDates,
    onDateSelected = { date -> selectDate(date) }
)

// Exercise tracking
ExerciseCard(
    exerciseName = "Bench Press",
    sets = 3,
    reps = "8-12",
    weight = "80 kg",
