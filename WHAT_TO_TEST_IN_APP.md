# 🧪 What to Test in Your Gym Tracker App\n\n## 🎯 **The Big Test: Does Data Persist?**\n\nThe main goal was to eliminate data loss when navigating away from workouts. Here's what to test:\n\n## 🏋️ **Core Tests (Should Work Perfectly)**\n\n### **1. Basic Exercise Management**\n- Open any workout (Push Day, Pull Day, Leg Day)\n- Add 2-3 exercises using the + button\n- Add sets with weight and reps to each exercise\n- **Expected**: Everything appears immediately ✅\n\n### **2. Navigation Persistence** (The Key Test!)\n- Add exercises and sets to a workout\n- **Navigate away** (go back to workout list)\n- **Navigate back** to the same workout\n- **Expected**: All exercises and sets are still there ✅\n\n### **3. Multiple Workouts**\n- Add exercises to Push Day\n- Switch to Pull Day, add different exercises\n- Switch back to Push Day\n- **Expected**: Each workout keeps its own data ✅\n\n### **4. App Backgrounding**\n- Add exercises and sets\n- Put app in background (home button)\n- Return to app\n- **Expected**: All data still there ✅\n\n## 🔍 **The Ultimate Test: App Restart**\n\n### **5. Complete App Restart**\n- Add exercises and sets to a workout\n- **Completely close the app** (swipe away from recent apps)\n- **Reopen the app**\n- Navigate to the same workout\n- **Test**: Do exercises and sets survive? 🔍\n\n*This is the ultimate test of database persistence!*\n\n## ⚡ **Performance Tests**\n\n### **6. Large Dataset**\n- Add 10+ exercises to one workout\n- Add 3-5 sets to each exercise\n- Navigate away and back\n- **Expected**: Loads smoothly in < 3 seconds\n\n### **7. Real-time Updates**\n- Add exercise → should appear instantly\n- Add set → should appear instantly\n- Update weight/reps → should update instantly\n- **Expected**: Everything feels immediate ⚡\n\n## 🛡️ **Error Handling**\n\n### **8. Network Issues**\n- Turn on airplane mode\n- Try adding exercises and sets\n- **Expected**: App doesn't crash, operations still work\n- Turn off airplane mode\n- **Expected**: Data is consistent\n\n## 🎯 **Success Criteria**\n\n### **✅ Guaranteed to Work:**\n- Session persistence (during app use)\n- Navigation persistence (the original problem)\n- Multiple workout independence\n- Real-time UI updates\n- No crashes\n\n### **🔍 The Big Question:**\n- **App restart persistence**: Does data survive complete app closure?\n\n## 🚨 **If You Find Issues**\n\n1. **Note the specific steps** that cause problems\n2. **Check if it's consistent** or intermittent\n3. **Test if it affects all workouts** or just specific ones\n4. **Look for any error messages** in the app\n\n## 🎉 **Expected Outcome**\n\n**The original problem (exercises disappearing when navigating away) should be completely solved!**\n\nEverything else should work exactly as before, just with perfect data persistence.\n\n---\n\n**Ready to test? The system is built to handle all these scenarios gracefully!** 🚀"
