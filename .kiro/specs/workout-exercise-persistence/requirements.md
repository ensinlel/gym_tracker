# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses the critical need for permanent persistence of workout exercises and sets data. Currently, exercises added to workouts are only stored in memory and are lost when the app is closed or removed from the task manager. Users expect their workout data to persist permanently across app sessions, making this a high-priority feature for a functional workout tracking application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Permanent Exercise Storage

**User Story:** As a user, I want my workout exercises to be saved permanently so that I don't lose my workout progress when I close and reopen the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add an exercise to a workout THEN the exercise SHALL be saved to the database immediately
2. WHEN I close the app and reopen it THEN all previously added exercises SHALL still be visible in their respective workouts
3. WHEN I remove the app from task manager and reopen it THEN all workout data SHALL persist
4. WHEN I restart my device and open the app THEN all workout exercises SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 2: Set and Rep Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my sets, weights, and reps data to be saved permanently so that I can track my progress over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add a set to an exercise THEN the set data SHALL be saved to the database
2. WHEN I update weight or reps for a set THEN the changes SHALL be persisted immediately
3. WHEN I reopen the app THEN all set data SHALL be restored exactly as I left it
4. WHEN I view an exercise THEN I SHALL see all previously recorded sets with correct weight and rep values

### Requirement 3: Database Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate the existing database infrastructure so that workout exercises use proper persistence instead of in-memory storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exercises are added to workouts THEN they SHALL be stored using ExerciseInstance entities in the database
2. WHEN sets are added to exercises THEN they SHALL be stored using WorkoutSet entities in the database
3. WHEN the app loads workout data THEN it SHALL retrieve data from the database repositories
4. WHEN data is modified THEN it SHALL use the existing repository pattern for consistency

### Requirement 4: Data Migration

**User Story:** As a user with existing workout data, I want my current session data to be preserved when the app is upgraded to use database persistence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is updated with database persistence THEN any existing in-memory data SHALL be migrated to the database
2. WHEN migration occurs THEN no workout data SHALL be lost
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN the app SHALL function normally with database persistence
4. IF migration fails THEN the app SHALL provide clear error messaging and fallback behavior

### Requirement 5: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to remain fast and reliable when saving and loading my workout data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add exercises or sets THEN the UI SHALL remain responsive during database operations
2. WHEN I navigate between workouts THEN data SHALL load quickly from the database
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the app SHALL handle errors gracefully and inform the user
4. WHEN I perform multiple rapid operations THEN all data SHALL be saved correctly without conflicts

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app interface and functionality to remain the same while gaining permanent data storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database persistence is implemented THEN the UI SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN I interact with workouts and exercises THEN the behavior SHALL be identical to the current experience
3. WHEN I add, edit, or delete exercises THEN the operations SHALL work exactly as they do now
4. WHEN I view workout titles and exercise names THEN they SHALL display correctly as they currently do

### Requirement 7: Data Integrity

**User Story:** As a user, I want my workout data to be accurate and consistent across all app sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add an exercise to a workout THEN it SHALL be associated with the correct workout ID
2. WHEN I add sets to an exercise THEN they SHALL be linked to the correct exercise instance
3. WHEN I view workout statistics THEN they SHALL reflect the actual persisted data
4. WHEN data conflicts occur THEN the app SHALL resolve them in favor of the most recent user action
